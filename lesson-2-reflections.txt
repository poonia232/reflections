What happens when you initialize a repository? 
Why do you need to do it?
git creates a .git file in the directory,it keeps 
track of all the commits and basically helps to 
create commits and go back in time
Well i need it if i make a stupid mistake

How is the staging area different from the working
directory and the repository? What value do you think it
offers?
The staging area is the place in between working
directory and repository.it offers the ease of 
commit similar files in one go and leaving logically
different files for another commit
