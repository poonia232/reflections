When would you want to use a remote repository rather 
than keeping all your work local?
well mulitple reasons, firslty someone else might
be working on the same project so it is good
for sharing secondly you might change your computer

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather 
than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your 
remote repository?
because you might be working on something and you
don't want the changes someone else made to project
downloaded to your code becuase that will just mess 
it up

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and 
branches. When would you use one instead of another?
branches are used when you want to try a feature which
is either in experimental stage and is not yet ready for
main branch. fork is done when you want to make a copy of 
someone's repository on github and clone is when you want
a local copy of a github repo
