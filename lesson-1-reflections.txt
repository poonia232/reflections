well seeing both version of the file; old 
and new one; helps you to recall why you made
made that change in the first place

How could having easy access to the entire
 history of a file make you a more 
efficient programmer in the long term?
because sometimes you have a idea and then you
fuck up your whole project and you want to go back
in the time and undo that...well version control
saves you the trouble of making a time machine

What do you think are the pros and cons of
manually choosing when to create a commit, like 
you do in Git, vs having versions automatically 
saved, like Google Docs does?
cons are; first it depends on user; and added work for the user
pros are; it makes sense, every checkpoint makes sense.

Why do you think some version control systems, 
like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit,
 while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
this is so becuase the code files are related to each other 
but in docs etc mostly it is text files which are predominantly
independent of each other so there is no need to do commit all files

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to 
view the history of files?
git log basically shows the total no of commits there have been and
using that data i can look onto a particular commit and
go into further details

How might using version control make you more confident 
to make changes that could break something?
it really helps to know that i can go back to earlier
version if something goes wrong at all

Now that you have your workspace set up, 
what do you want to try using Git for?
first of all i am going to use git to complete this course 
after that i am going to use it for android studio projects
and hopefully later on for some back end work
